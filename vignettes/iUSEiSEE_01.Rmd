# `iUSEiSEE`: a masterclass-level workshop on iSEE

The iSEE package [@Rue-Albrecht2018-isee] is a flexible, powerful and extendible application to explore any dataset stored in SummarizedExperiment objects, including single cell and spatially resolved data. 

This workshop and associated workshop package contain all the materials you might need to have a full experience and learn how to use iSEE, hands on, starting from the basics and making your way up to the more advanced features.

This vignette contains a compact version of the more extended material of all other detailed vignettes. 
Feel free to use this as a compact index for the rest!

In brief, you will...

* Install all required packages and software
* Go get some data
* See how easy it is to run `iSEE`
* Obtain a quick overview of the panels and the user interface
* Get to know the more advanced features of `iSEE`
* Be able to use `iSEE` on your own data (and maybe even deploy that!)

Ready? Let's go!

# Installing and loading the required packages

To run the content presented in this demo, run this following chunk in your R environment.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("imbeimainz/iUSEiSEE")

```

We start by loading the packages that will be used during the demo. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("SingleCellExperiment")
library("iSEE")
library("TENxPBMCData")

library("iSEEu")
library("iSEEde")
library("iSEEpathways")
library("iSEEhub")
library("iSEEindex")
```

All of these would be loaded if you run

```{r}
library("iUSEiSEE")
```

You can also clone this repository (https://imbeimainz.github.io/iUSEiSEE) locally by `git clone` - it makes it easy to follow along this vignette!

# Let's go get us some data!

We will start very much *in medias res*, assuming that this might be the ideal point where you have processed your data - early or late phase - and now want to have the BEST look at that.

Navigate to https://zenodo.org/records/10084595 and download the data (it contains the three objects you might be "coming from").  
Unpack the archive you downloaded in the `datasets` subfolder of the `vignette` folder.

We included a `SingleCellExperiment` object on a processed version for the PBMC3k dataset, many of you can somehow be familiar with this.

Let's load the dataset in our environment:

```{r}
sce_pbmc3k <- readRDS(
  file = system.file("datasets", "sce_pbmc3k.RDS", package = "iUSEiSEE")
)

sce_pbmc3k
```


# As easy as saying `iSEE(sce)`!

Who of you is investing a fair amount/lot of time in doing proper data exploration?

Who of you is familiar with the beautiful CellxGene tool?

Who of you dreamed to do even more on your data?

I have a quiz for you - have a look at this, for example:

http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/iSEE_Tonsils_CD4Tcells/

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ss_Tcells.png")
```

<details>
<summary>Question 1</summary>
How many lines of code are required to realize this?

A) 4-5  
B) 250-300 
C) 7500-10000  
</details>


<details>
<summary>Question 2</summary>
How many of these lines had to be typed by a human?

A) 4-5  
B) 250-300  
C) 7500-10000  
</details>

So, yes, I will show you that is as easy as that:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("iSEE")
iSEE(sce_pbmc3k)
```

Let's run this together and see what we have got in store.

Schedule:

- go get the dataset
- overview on the iSEE interface as a whole
  - panels
  - controls
  - all ui elements


- the iSEE challenge: let's reproduce any figure?
- 















# Quick tour of the panels

What typical visualizations people would you use to represent and explore your datasets?

Each panel has some essential content:

* Data parameters
* Visual parameters
* Selection parameters

Let's have a closer look at that on the Reduced Dimension Plot 1 panel.

If you have no idea of what a panel can "normally" do, look for the question mark icon, that will start a tiny tour on its functionality.

# Additional UI functionality

iSEE also has some additional controls, grouped into the header bar, let's have a look at them:

* Organization buttons
* Export buttons
* Documentation buttons
* Extra info buttons

With this, we can...

- reorganize the panel layout - add, remove, re-order
- extract the code to exactly reproduce the outputs, 1:1
- store (and re-utilize) the panel settings
- generate at once an archive with all/selected parts of the panel outputs
- start a tour on the content displayed - yes, you can very much tell a story with iSEE!

# In depth exploration of data - iSEE's main functionality 

## You can control pretty much everything in a plot

Coloring by, faceting, zooming, hovering!  
Make a wish!

## You can link any panel to any other panel

Brush selection, lasso selection, select the receiving panel, iterate!  
Read out information, see the panel transmission graph.

## You can use tables to navigate panels

Search and select, transmit, receive, iterate!

## Configuring your iSEE instance

Panels: add, move, remove; exporting the `initial` configuration, reloading it

## Reproducibility for the win!

A magic wand: two clicks away from all the R code you need; export all outputs, save individual images

## Sharing is caring, and so is telling a story

Start the tour, highlighting elements; make your data really explorable!

# Custom panels & the iSEE universe

A couple of additional things you can do with custom panels (and this is just an appetizer!):

* Custom panels: perform some extra steps
* Multiple selection and "DE on the fly"
* Check out `r Biocpkg("iSEEu")` for more
* Spatial data? We can already handle that with a workaround! See https://moffittlab.connect.hms.harvard.edu/merfish/merfish_homepage.html for an example

# Got data?

## Got single cell data?

You might have got the gist:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sce <- sce_pbmc3k # Load your data in some manner
library("iSEE")
iSEE(sce)
```

So, yes, we mighe be down to THREE lines of code.

## Got some special feature in your data?

Maybe `r Biocpkg("iSEEu")` can be the place to find already that piece of functionality!

## Got bulk?

Have a look at the functionality provided by 

* `r Biocpkg("iSEEde")`
* `r Biocpkg("iSEEpathways")`

These can be ideal companions for exploring DE results.

`r Biocpkg("iSEEde")` and `r Biocpkg("iSEEpathways")` are two new Bioconductor packages that provide `r Biocpkg("iSEE")` panels specifically aimed towards exploration of differential expression and pathway analysis results. 
More precisely, `r Biocpkg("iSEEde")` provides the `VolcanoPlot`, `MAPlot`, `LogFCLogFCPlot` and `DETable` panels. 

## Got many datasets?

Have a look at the functionality provided by 

* `r Biocpkg("iSEEhub")`
* `r Biocpkg("iSEEindex")`

The `r Biocpkg("iSEEhub")` package provides a custom landing page for an `r Biocpkg("iSEE")` application interfacing with the Bioconductor `r Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")`. 
The landing page allows users to browse the ExperimentHub, select a data set, download and cache it, and import it directly into an iSEE app.

`r Biocpkg("iSEEindex")` provides an interface to **any** collection of data sets within a single iSEE web-application.  
The main functionality of this package is to define a custom landing page allowing app maintainers to list a custom collection of data sets that users can select from and directly load objects into an iSEE web application.  

> One iSEE instance to ~~rule~~ exlore them all...

A more elaborate example is available at [https://rehwinkellab.shinyapps.io/ifnresource/](https://rehwinkellab.shinyapps.io/ifnresource/). 
The source can be found at [https://github.com/kevinrue/IFNresource](https://github.com/kevinrue/IFNresource). 

<!-- Possible actions: -->
<!-- navigate to github repo -->
<!-- explore the app.R file -->
<!-- check the initial state files -->
<!-- have a look at the configuration yaml -->

Potential use cases can include:

* An app to present and explore the different datasets in your next publication
* An app to explore collection of datasets collaboratively, in consortium-like initiatives
* An app to mirror and enhance the content of e.g. the CellxGene data portal
* Got any ideas on how to use iSEE for such deployments?

# Interoperability

"Wait, I got Seurat/Anndata objects".

The single cell communities got you covered:

## From Seurat...

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("Seurat")

seurat_object <- readRDS("datasets/seurat_pbmc3k.RDS")
sce_from_seurat <- Seurat::as.SingleCellExperiment(
  seurat_object
)
sce_from_seurat


iSEE(sce_from_seurat)
```

## From AnnData...

... which is basically able to serve any dataset available throught the CELLxGENE Data Portal!

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("zellkonverter")

sce_from_anndata <- zellkonverter::readH5AD(file = "datasets/anndata_pbmc3k.h5ad")
sce_from_anndata

iSEE(sce_from_anndata)
```

An example could be...

# I want moaaaaar on iSEE!
