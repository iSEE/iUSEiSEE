              biological data sets generated by high-throughput assays such as
              sequencing. However, most existing tools for interactive
              visualisation are limited to specific assays or analyses. Here,
              we present the iSEE (Interactive SummarizedExperiment Explorer)
              software package, which provides a general visual interface for
              exploring data in a SummarizedExperiment object. iSEE is directly
              compatible with many existing R/Bioconductor packages for
              analysing high-throughput biological data, and provides useful
              features such as simultaneous examination of (meta)data and
              analysis results, dynamic linking between plots and code tracking
              for reproducibility. We demonstrate the utility and flexibility
              of iSEE by applying it to explore a range of real transcriptomics
              and proteomics data sets.",
