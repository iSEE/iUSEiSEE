@article{Bartneck2023,
abstract = {Tumor development and progression is shaped by the tumor microenvironment (TME), a heterogeneous assembly of infiltrating and resident host cells, their secreted mediators and intercellular matrix. In this context, tumors are infiltrated by various immune cells with either pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral functions. Recently, we published our non-invasive immunization platform DIVA suitable as a therapeutic vaccination method, further optimized by repeated application (DIVA 2 ). In our present work, we revealed the therapeutic effect of DIVA 2 in an MC38 tumor model and specifically focused on the mechanisms induced in the TME after immunization. DIVA 2 resulted in transient tumor control followed by an immune evasion phase within three weeks after the initial tumor inoculation. High-dimensional flow cytometry analysis and single-cell mRNA-sequencing of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes revealed cytotoxic CD8 + T cells as key players in the immune control phase. In the immune evasion phase, inflammatory CCR2 + PDL-1 + monocytes with immunosuppressive properties were recruited into the tumor leading to suppression of DIVA 2 -induced tumor-reactive T cells. Depletion of CCR2 + cells with specific antibodies resulted in prolonged survival revealing CCR2 + monocytes as important for tumor immune escape in the TME. In summary, the present work provides a platform for generating a strong antigen-specific primary and memory T cell immune response using the optimized transcutaneous immunization method DIVA 2 . This enables protection against tumors by therapeutic immune control of solid tumors and highlights the immunosuppressive influence of tumor infiltrating CCR2 + monocytes that need to be inactivated in addition for successful cancer immunotherapy.},

@article{Alasoo2018,
abstract = {Regulatory variants are often context specific, modulating gene expression in a subset of possible cellular states. Although these genetic effects can play important roles in disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying context specificity are poorly understood. Here, we identified shared quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human macrophages exposed to IFN$\gamma$, Salmonella and IFN$\gamma$ plus Salmonella. We observed that {\~{}}60{\%} of stimulus-specific expression QTLs with a detectable effect on chromatin altered the chromatin accessibility in naive cells, thus suggesting that they perturb enhancer priming. Such variants probably influence binding of cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as PU.1, which can then indirectly alter the binding of stimulus-specific transcription factors, such as NF-$\kappa$B or STAT2. Thus, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine-mapping causal regulatory variants, detecting their downstream effects on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and time points.},

@article{Love2014,
abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.},
